# Towards Better Statistical Understanding of Watermarking LLMs

## Structure

The `WatermarkAlgorithm` folder holds the watermarking algorithms. Our Dual Gradient Ascent algorithm is implemented in `WatermarkAlgorithm/utils/DualGD_generator.py`.

## Experiments

The `experiments` folder holds the experiment scripts on 3 most standard settings. When running the scrips, make sure to replace the "path/to/..." parts with the real path.
